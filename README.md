## The Significance of Face Mask Detection

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of wearing face masks as a simple yet effective measure to prevent the spread of the virus. Our Face Mask Detection System offers a cutting-edge solution to enforce mask-wearing protocols in public spaces. By seamlessly integrating hardware and software components, we've created a robust system capable of identifying individuals without masks and alerting them promptly.

## Key Technologies and Components

### 1. Raspberry Pi 4

At the heart of our system lies the Raspberry Pi 4, a versatile single-board computer that serves as the brain of our project. Its compact size, low power consumption, and GPIO pins make it an ideal choice for this endeavor.

### 2. Camera

We've equipped our Raspberry Pi with a camera module to capture images of individuals within its vicinity. This crucial component ensures accurate face detection and image capture.

### 3. Power Bank

Portability is key to our project's success. We've incorporated a power bank to ensure that our system can be deployed in remote locations without access to a stable power source.

### 4. Tensorflow

Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework, is instrumental in our deep learning model for face mask detection. It enables us to train and fine-tune our model for high accuracy.

### 5. OpenCV

OpenCV, with its robust computer vision libraries, powers the facial detection algorithm using XML files. This technology allows our system to identify faces within its field of view.

### 6. Face Detection and Recognition

Our project leverages state-of-the-art face detection and recognition techniques. We've integrated deep learning and artificial intelligence to accurately identify individuals.

## Project Workflow

Our Face Mask Detection System operates seamlessly in the following structured workflow:

1. **Motion Detection**: The Raspberry Pi continuously monitors for motion. When it detects motion, the system activates.

2. **Face Detection and Image Capture**: Using OpenCV's frontal face algorithm, the system identifies faces within the frame and captures images of individuals.

3. **Image Compression and AWS Integration**: The captured images are compressed and sent to an AWS S3 bucket at specific intervals. This process helps in conserving storage space on the Raspberry Pi.

4. **AWS EC2 Instance Activation**: Simultaneously, an AWS EC2 instance is activated to retrieve the compressed image files from the S3 bucket.

5. **Face Mask Detection**: On the AWS EC2 instance, the images are uncompressed and analyzed using our trained deep learning model to detect individuals without masks.

6. **Person Identification**: The system compares the detected faces against a database of known individuals, thanks to contributions from our classmates and faculty. Identified individuals' names are retrieved.

7. **Alert Mechanism**: For individuals not recognized in the database, their images are sent to an admin email to ensure proactive monitoring.

8. **Email Notifications**: The system sends email notifications to individuals identified without masks, reminding them to wear oneâ€”a vital safety measure in the ongoing pandemic.

## Project Implementation: A Deeper Dive

### 1. Team Collaboration

Our project's success is a result of seamless collaboration among team members. Each member brought their unique expertise to the table, from hardware configuration to machine learning model development.

### 2. Hardware Setup

Setting up the Raspberry Pi, camera, and power bank required meticulous attention to detail. We ensured that the system was portable and could function autonomously in any location.

### 3. Training the Model

Tensorflow played a pivotal role in training our deep learning model. We curated a diverse dataset of masked and unmasked faces, fine-tuning the model until it achieved exceptional accuracy.

### 4. AWS Integration

Integrating AWS services, such as S3 and EC2, required configuring permissions, setting up automation with Cron jobs, and ensuring secure data transmission.

### 5. Face Recognition Database

Our project benefited from the contributions of classmates and faculty who provided one-minute video clips showcasing various facial expressions. These clips were instrumental in creating a comprehensive database of recognized individuals, enabling real-time identification.
### 6. Alert Mechanism

The alert system was designed to be swift and accurate. For unrecognized individuals, images were promptly sent to the admin email for further action.
